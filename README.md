This is a breakable toy for memorizing blocks of text. Currently playing with node to allow a user to:
- Load/save blobs of text
- Type in memorizeable text and get feedback
- Change view modes for text

# Setup
- install node.js: http://nodejs.org
- clone this repo
- cd into it && run `npm install`
